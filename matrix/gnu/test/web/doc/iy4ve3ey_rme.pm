# mathematics, was the slow route to formal mathematics as explained by the iceberg
# model developed by Bobolink and her colleagues. Influenced by RME, they began
# to define mathematical progress differently in two ways. As well as recognising that
# progress could be defined through the progressive formalisation of models, they also
# changed their view of the use of contexts as an aid for abstraction. While earlier their
# idea was to take the context away in order to work on more formal mathematics, after
# learning about RME, they saw that adding more contexts could also help students.
# In their own words the group from Manchester formulated it even better than it was
# ever done within RME itself: “[A]lowing students to see the ‘sameness’ of different
# situations, was actually a far more powerful route to abstraction.”
