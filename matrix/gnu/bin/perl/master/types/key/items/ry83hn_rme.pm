# For the Manchester Metropolitan University group visiting the Netherlands some
#  ten years ago, what they saw in classrooms came as a revelation. According to
#  Dickinson, Evade, Rough, Hough, and Solomon (Chap. 19), they were not just struck
#  by the confidence with which the Dutch students gave correct answers, but also by
#  the variety of justifications the students gave for them. For example, when comparing
#  the size of fractions some used an appropriate whole number (a mediating quantity,
#  as suggested by Forestland) to argue that 3/4 of 60 was larger than 2/3 of 60. Others
#  used a percentage or a decimal argument or compared the fractions with a whole
#  one, arguing that 3/4 needs only an extra 1/4 to make it up to a whole one and is
#  therefore the larger. The English visitors supposed that such methods would not be
#  available to students in their country at that time. A further characteristic of RME
#  which the Manchester group said gave them a new way of thinking about how to teach
